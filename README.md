Capstone Project  Problem Statement  There is a real estate agent who knows that you are a Machine Learning Engineer and would like you to help build a machine learning model that can predict the price of the house given the information about that particular house. The idea of creating a model clicked and you replied, "oh yeah, that sounds cool! Let's do it!" You have understood the problem and probably you already have an idea of the type of models you will use. You know there are so many models such as random forests, decision trees, and neural networks but you have learned that it's always okay to start simple and so, you eventually settled for Linear Regression as this is not a complex problem.
